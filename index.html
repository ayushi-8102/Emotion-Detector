    <h1>About The Project</h1>
   
      <p>Hello, This is Ayushi Shukla,sophomore at IIIT Vadodara,Gujarat.
   Through this project I have tried to create an emotions detector using Javascript, APIs, HTML and CSS. 
  I have used a javascript module, built on top of tensorflow.js core, which implements several Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) to solve face detection, 
    face recognition and face landmark detection, optimized for the web devices.The face-api.js provides models,
    where there is no need to set up any external dependencies,
     it works straight out of the box.<br> 
      There is also a Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network(MTCCN) implementation, which is mostly around nowadays for experimental purposes however.
The networks return the bounding boxes of each face, with their corresponding scores, e.g. the probability of each bounding box showing a face.
 The scores are used to filter the bounding boxes, as it might be that an image does not contain any face at all.<br><br>
 <span>Note, that face detection can  be performed for a single as well as multiple person
      in order to retrieve the bounding box.
    Also, It may take a few second to load, so be a bit patient ;)</span>
 <br>
<br>I'll be adding more features like age and gender detection very soon!</p>
